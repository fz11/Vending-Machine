# Vending-Machine
   This repository consists of a simplified vending machine that was created using 
Verilog in Xlinx Vivado for describing the hardware and Cadence Encounter SoC for 
mapping and routing a layout to be exported out in as a GDSII/OASIS file. Please 
refer to the 'Vending Machine Final Report.pdf' file for full information in regards 
to the functionality and tests of the machine.
